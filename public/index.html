            <h1>Introduction to Campaign: Grimlark Darkness Within</h1>
            <p>
              The world is very dark and grim, you get this feeling that this world is dusk
              and descerted. You see off in the distance darkness, the towns and buildings ran
              down and some even destroyed. The only light emitted are from townfolk lanterns &
              street lights that are powered by some sort of magic or fuel you can't really tell...
            </p>
            <p>
              The emotions on the people's faces look saddened and hopeless, living their lives in 
              labour as their only form of survival. Even if you were thinking of finding out more
              information, that knowledge is very scarced, and frown upon in this society, almost 
              like an enforced conduct has washed over the minds.
            </p>
            <p>
              You all being in a tavern that has a strange aroma, almost a must frangrance that
              smells of false riches. There is however a desirable bulletin board with bold letters
              inscribed as "Jobs" with a gold trim around the edges. You get a sense somebody cares 
              alot about this board. All of you have no relations with eachother while you all sit 
              at different tables and chairs in this grimy place. But you all are drawn to this 
              bulletin board, specifically a certain task, one that your eye's lock on.. "Slay Lucifer
              1000 gold".
            </p>
            <p>
              Infront of the board a woman with a cloak and daggers equipped to her legs, stands
              determined, staring at the board.
            </p>
            <h2>Woman with Cloak & Daggers -> Skylar Silvermask</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Split Personality</li>
              <p>Adventure driven, hardwork, enjoys a challenge, caring/team oriented</p>
              <p>Seeks to train the adventurers before fighting Lucifer</p>
              <li>Backstory:</li>
              <p>Came through back alley brawls, trains all her life in the dumps and alleys</p>
              <p>
                She needs this money to feed and take care of the orphans and odd ball creatures
                that live in Grimlark
              </p>
              <li>Second Personality</li>
              <p>
                Dark, shady, evil personality that is controlled by the council that runs the city
                Her second personality has no correlation, and her memories are seperate. (She basically
                lures adverturers to their ends and that's how the council controls Grimlark by killing
                and pilfering all adventurers of their loot and belongings.)
              </p>
              <p>
                She turns against the party in the last stage where she leads the group to an alley
                that has been remoured as the "Lucifer's Alley/Corner" which is actually an ambush by the council.
              </p>
              <p>The police force (controlled by council) find the party & Skylar training and inform
                the party that Lucifer's Alley is causing mischief in the city and that they need help
                from the party and Skylar. (A ploy/regular routine set by the council)
              </p>
            </ul>
            <h1>Lucifer's Alley/Corner</h1>
            <p>
              The player's get ambushed in the alley 2 archers (1 on either side of the broken down buildings)
              These archers have special arrowheads that are dipped in a chemical that incapacitates the players 
              after 3 failed CON saves.
            </p>
            <p>
              2 Archers on the top of the building infront
            </p>
            <p>
              3 Body guards that are enclosing the players in from the back
              <!--Image of scene for dm-->
            </p>
            <p>
              Dialogue: A dark figure in a trench coat snaps his fingers and Skylar's personality changes,
              in seconds, the emotion on her face wethers and all there is left is this devilish grin. In 
              a flash the trench coat figure vanishes into a black sparrow type bird and flies away. The direction
              is unknown due to the darkness and the buildings blocking the angle in seconds.
            </p>
            <h2>Save Skylar:</h2>
            <p>
              Incapacitate her, the archer's firing the dipped arrows if getting a hold of one and striking
              Skylar with it will make her incapacitated instantly as the chemical is super effective against her.
            </p>
            <p>Alternatively, her split personality lasts 5 minutes = 50 turns in combat</p>
            <p>Thirdly, reducing her hitpoints to 0 works as well.</p>
            <p>Info: Buildings on the sides are broken down, archers are shooting from 1st floor
              (10ft). Archers from infront are shooting from the top of the building (40ft).
            </p>
            <p>If Skylar is saved, the player's continue to get lodging and food, etc. As Skylar,
              is a relative of the person that owns the tavern.
            </p>
